# contao-glossy_tango

Glossy Tango Theme for Contao CMS, which uses a dark grey background, green 
headers and icons from the [Tango Project](http://www.freedesktop.org/).

You need to have [Contao](https://contao.org) installed and running.
This git repository is for development purposes only. You can install the 
official releases more easily by using Contao's extension repository.
